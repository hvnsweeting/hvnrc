Drawing 2D graphics
2 ways:
# draw into a View obj from your layout, handle by the system's normal View hierarchy. Using when draw simple graphics, do not need to change or change slowly
- extend the View class then define onDraw(canvas). Must request your View be invalideted by calling invalidate() before draw

# draw directly to a Canvas. call onDraw() or draw...(). Use when need regularly redraw 
- 2 ways: same thread as your UI activity, when create a custom View component, call invalidate() then handle onDraw()
	- in a separate thread, manage SurfaceView and draws to the Canvas
