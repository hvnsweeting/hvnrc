Unit 1:
excite

AI program is called Intelligent agent

  	sensors
agent 		environment
	actuators
	
AI has successfully been used in finance, robotic, games, medicine, theweb

#terminology (thuat ngu)
fully vs partially observable: (memoizing to decide)
perception - action cycle

deterministic vs stochastic:
1.agent's action determine outcome
2. random can affect

discrete vs continuous:
1. finally many choices
2. infinite

benign vs adversarial:
1.no objective to contradict your own ojectiv
2.environment is out to get you

Unit2 Problem solving
(s: state
a: action
n: number)

problem can broke down to many component:

inital state
action(s) -> {a,a2,a3...}
result(s, a) -> s'
goalTest(s) -> T/F
pathCost(s-(a)->s-(a)->s) -> n
+ stepCost(s,a,s') -> n

frontier
unexplored
explored

Tree search
Graph search (avoid repeat the path) : good for find least step


BFS (Breadth first search) :

Uniform cost search (Cheapest first): find optimal path


DFS : space save  
may not find the goal if tree is infinitive

Greedy best-first search

A star algorithm (A*)
f = g + h
if h(s) < true cost

search work when
domain:
fully boservable
known action
discrete
deterministic
static
